<em>Midwest Energy News</em> is taking a short holiday break, and we want to pause briefly to thank you, our readers, for another great year.

From its launch in 2010, this site has grown into a widely recognized resource for coverage of the clean energy transition that might otherwise go unnoticed in other media outlets.
